## Cloud Functions

For more info about Cloud Functions check:

[[../gcp-services/gcp-cloud-functions-enum.md]]

### Persistence Techniques

- **Modify the code** of the Cloud Function, even just the `requirements.txt`
- **Allow anyone** to call a vulnerable Cloud Function or a backdoor one
- **Trigger** a Cloud Function when something happens to infect something
