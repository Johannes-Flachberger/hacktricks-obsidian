# Chef Automate Security

## What is Chef Automate

Chef Automate is a platform for infrastructure automation, compliance, and application delivery. It exposes a web UI (often Angular) that talks to backend gRPC services via a gRPC-Gateway, providing REST-like endpoints under paths such as /api/v0/.

- Common backend components: gRPC services, PostgreSQL (often visible via pq: error prefixes), data-collector ingest service
- Auth mechanisms: user/API tokens and a data collector token header x-data-collector-token
