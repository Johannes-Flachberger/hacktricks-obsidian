# Az - Permissions for a Pentest

To start a white box hardening review of some Entra ID tenats you need to ask for **`Global Reader` role on each tenant**. Moreover, to perform a hardening review of different Azure subscriptions you would need at least the **`Reader`role over all the subscriptions**.

Note that if those roles aren't enough to access all the info you need, you could also ask the client for roles with the permissions you need. Just try to **minimize the amount of not read-only permissions you ask for!**

Another option is to ask for **`Security Reader` role** instead of `Reader` if the client complaints to reduce the granted privileges. However, this increases the possibility of the pentester asking for more read roles later as the `Reader` role grants `"*/read"` while the `Security Reader` role grants:

]
