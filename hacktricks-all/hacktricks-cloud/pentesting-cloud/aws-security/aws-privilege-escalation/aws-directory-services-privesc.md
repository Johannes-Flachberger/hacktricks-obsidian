# AWS - Directory Services Privesc

## Directory Services

For more info about directory services check:

[[../aws-services/aws-directory-services-workdocs-enum.md]]

### `ds:ResetUserPassword`

This permission allows to **change** the **password** of any **existent** user in the Active Directory.\
By default, the only existent user is **Admin**.

```
aws ds reset-user-password --directory-id <id> --user-name Admin --new-password Newpassword123.
```

### AWS Management Console

It's possible to enable an **application access URL** that users from AD can access to login:

And then **grant them an AWS IAM role** for when they login, this way an AD user/group will have access over AWS management console:

There isn't apparently any way to enable the application access URL, the AWS Management Console and grant permission
