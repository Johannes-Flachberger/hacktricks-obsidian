# AWS - Lambda Post Exploitation

## Lambda

For more information check:

[[../../aws-services/aws-lambda-enum.md]]

### Exfilrtate Lambda Credentials

Lambda uses environment variables to inject credentials at runtime. If you can get access to them (by reading `/proc/self/environ` or using the vulnerable function itself), you can use them yourself. They live in the default variable names `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`. 

By default, these will have access to write to a cloudwatch log group (the name of which is stored in `AWS_LAMBDA_LOG_GROUP_NAME`), as well as to create arbitrary log groups, however lambda functions frequently have more permissions assigned based on their intended use.

### Steal Others Lambda URL Requests

If an attacker somehow manage to get RCE inside a Lambda he will be able to steal other users HTTP requests to the lambda. If the requests contain sensitive information (cookies, credentials...) he will be able to steal them.

### Steal Others Lambda URL Requests & Extensions Requests

Abusing Lambda Layers it's also possible to abuse extensions and persist in the lambda but also steal and modify requests.

### AWS Lambda – VPC Egress Bypass

Force a Lambda function out of a restricted VPC by updating its configuration with an empty VpcConfig (SubnetIds=[], SecurityGroupIds=[]). The function will then run in the Lambda-managed networking plane, regaining outbound internet access and bypassing egress controls enforced by private VPC subnets without NAT.

### AWS Lambda – Runtime Pinning/Rollback Abuse

Abuse `lambda:PutRuntimeManagementConfig` to pin a function to a specific runtime version (Manual) or freeze updates (FunctionUpdate). This preserves compatibility with malicious layers/wrappers and can keep the function on an outdated, vulnerable runtime to aid exploitation and long-term persistence.

### AWS Lambda – Log Siphon via LoggingConfig.LogGroup Redirection

Abuse `lambda:UpdateFunctionConfiguration` advanced logging controls to redirect a function’s logs to an attacker-chosen CloudWatch Logs log group. This works without changing code or the execution role (most Lambda roles already include `logs:CreateLogGroup/CreateLogStream/PutLogEvents` via `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole`). If the function prints secrets/request bodies or crashes with stack traces, you can collect them from the new log group.

### AWS - Lambda Function URL Public Exposure

Turn a private Lambda Function URL into a public unauthenticated endpoint by switching the Function URL AuthType to NONE and attaching a resource-based policy that grants lambda:InvokeFunctionUrl to everyone. This enables anonymous invocation of internal functions and can expose sensitive backend operations.

[[aws-lambda-function-url-public-exposure.md]]

### AWS Lambda – Event Source Mapping Target Hijack

Abuse `UpdateEventSourceMapping` to change the target Lambda function of an existing Event Source Mapping (ESM) so that records from DynamoDB Streams, Kinesis, or SQS are delivered to an attacker-controlled function. This silently diverts live data without touching producers or the original function code.

[[aws-lambda-event-source-mapping-hijack.md]]

### AWS Lambda – EFS Mount Injection data exfiltration

Abuse `lambda:UpdateFunctionConfiguration` to attach an existing EFS Access Point to a Lambda, then deploy trivial code that lists/reads files from the mounted path to exfiltrate shared secrets/config that the function previously couldn’t access.
