### Publicly Accessible Security Group or Load Balancer for ECS Services

A misconfigured security group that **allows inbound traffic from the internet (0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0)** to the Amazon ECS services could expose the AWS resources to attacks.

```bash
# Example of detecting misconfigured security group for ECS services
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --query 'SecurityGroups[?IpPermissions[?contains(IpRanges[].CidrIp, `0.0.0.0/0`) || contains(Ipv6Ranges[].CidrIpv6, `::/0`)]]'

# Example of detecting a publicly accessible load balancer for ECS services
aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers --query 'LoadBalancers[?Scheme == `internet-facing`]'
```
