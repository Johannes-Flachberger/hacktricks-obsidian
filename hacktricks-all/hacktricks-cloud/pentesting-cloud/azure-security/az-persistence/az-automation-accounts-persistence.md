# Az - Automation Accounts Persistence

### Backdoor existing runbook

If an attacker has access to the automation account, he could **add a backdoor** to an existing runbook to **maintain persistence** and **exfiltrate data** like tokens every time the runbook is executed.

###Â Schedules & Webhooks

Create or modify an existing Runbook and add a schedule or webhook to it. This will allow an attacker to **maintain persistence even if access over the environment was lost** by executing the backdoor which might be leaking tokens from the MI at specific times or whenever he wants by sending a request to the webhok.

### Malware inside a VM used in a hybrid worker group

If a VM is used as a hybrid worker group, an attacker could **install malware** inside the VM to **maintain persistence** and **exfiltrate data** like tokens for the managed identities given to the VM and to the automation account using the VM.

### Custom environment packages

If the automation account is using custom packages in custom environments, an attacker could **modify the package** to **maintain persistence** and **exfiltrate data** like tokens. This would also be a stealth persistence method as custom packages uploaded manually are rearely checked for malicious code.

### Compromise external repos

If the automation account is using external repos to store the code like Github, an attacker could **compromise the repo** to **maintain persistence** and **exfiltrate data** like tokens. This is specially interesting if the clatest evrsion of the code is automatically synced with the runbook.
