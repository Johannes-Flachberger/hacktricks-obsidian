# AWS - Lightsail Persistence

## Lightsail

For more information check:

[[../aws-services/aws-lightsail-enum.md]]

### Download Instance SSH keys & DB passwords

They won't be changed probably so just having them is a good option for persistence

### Backdoor Instances

An attacker could get access to the instances and backdoor them:

- Using a traditional **rootkit** for example
- Adding a new **public SSH key**
- Expose a port with port knocking with a backdoor

### DNS persistence

If domains are configured:

- Create a subdomain pointing your IP so you will have a **subdomain takeover**
- Create **SPF** record allowing you to send **emails** from the domain
- Configure the **main domain IP to your own one** and perform a **MitM** from your IP to the legit ones
