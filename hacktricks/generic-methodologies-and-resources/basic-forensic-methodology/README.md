# Basic Forensic Methodology


## Creating and Mounting an Image

## Malware Analysis

This **isn't necessary the first step to perform once you have the image**. But you can use this malware analysis techniques independently if you have a file, a file-system image, memory image, pcap... so it's good to **keep these actions in mind**:

## Inspecting an Image

if you are given a **forensic image** of a device you can start **analyzing the partitions, file-system** used and **recovering** potentially **interesting files** (even deleted ones). Learn how in:

Depending on the used OSs and even platform different interesting artifacts should be searched:

## Deep inspection of specific file-types and Software

If you have very **suspicious** **file**, then **depending on the file-type and software** that created it several **tricks** may be useful.\
