# GWS - Workspace Pentesting

## Entry Points

### Google Platforms and OAuth Apps Phishing

Check how you could use different Google platforms such as Drive, Chat, Groups... to send the victim a phishing link and how to perform a Google OAuth Phishing in:

[[gws-google-platforms-phishing/]]

### Password Spraying

In order to test passwords with all the emails you found (or you have generated based in a email name pattern you might have discover) you could use a tool like [**https://github.com/ustayready/CredKing**](https://github.com/ustayready/CredKing) (although it looks unmaintained) which will use AWS lambdas to change IP address.

## Post-Exploitation

If you have compromised some credentials or the session of the user you can perform several actions to access potential sensitive information of the user and to try to escala privileges:

### GWS <-->GCP Pivoting

Read more about the different techniques to pivot between GWS and GCP in:

## GWS <--> GCPW |Â GCDS | Directory Sync (AD & EntraID)

- **GCPW (Google Credential Provider for Windows)**: This is the single sign-on that Google Workspaces provides so users can login in their Windows PCs using **their Workspace credentials**. Moreover, this will **store tokens to access Google Workspace** in some places in the PC.
- **GCDS (Google CLoud DIrectory Sync)**: This is a tool that can be used to **sync your active directory users and groups to your Workspace**. The tool requires the **credentials of a Workspace superuser and privileged AD user**. So, it might be possible to find it inside a domain server that would be synchronising users from time to time.
- **Admin Directory Sync**: It allows you to synchronize users from AD and EntraID in a serverless process from [https://admin.google.com/ac/sync/externaldirectories](https://admin.google.com/ac/sync/externaldirectories).

## Persistence

If you have compromised some credentials or the session of the user check these options to maintain persistence over it:

[[gws-persistence.md]]

## Context-Aware Access

- **Context-Aware Access**: This is a security feature that allows organizations to enforce access policies based on the context of the user, device, and location. It enables granular control over who can access specific application within Google Workspace, enhancing security by ensuring that only trusted users and devices can access sensitive data.

It requires specific **licenses to be able to use it.**

This service basically allows you to create **Context-Aware access levels** which allow to configure different conditions that must be met. Access-level conditions contain attributes you can select, such as device policy, IP subnet, or another access level.

Then, it's possible to **assign these access levels to apps**. It's possible to assign more than one access level to an app, and the user must meet all the conditions of all the access levels assigned to that app.
