# AWS - SNS Unauthenticated Enum

## SNS

For more information about SNS check:

### Open to All

When you configure a SNS topic from the web console it's possible to indicate that **Everyone can publish and subscribe** to the topic:

So if you **find the ARN of topics** inside the account (or brute forcing potential names for topics) you can **check** if you can **publish** or **subscribe** to **them**.
