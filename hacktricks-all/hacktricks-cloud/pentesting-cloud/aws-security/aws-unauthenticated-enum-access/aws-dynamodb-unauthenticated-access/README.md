# AWS - DynamoDB Unauthenticated Access

## Dynamo DB

For more information check:

[[../../aws-services/aws-dynamodb-enum.md]]

Apart from giving access to all AWS or some compromised external AWS account, or have some SQL injections in an application that communicates with DynamoDB I'm don't know more options to access AWS accounts from DynamoDB.
