# GCP - IAM Post Exploitation

## IAM 

You can find further information about IAM in:

### Granting access to management console 

Access to the [GCP management console](https://console.cloud.google.com) is **provided to user accounts, not service accounts**. To log in to the web interface, you can **grant access to a Google account** that you control. This can be a generic "**@gmail.com**" account, it does **not have to be a member of the target organization**.

To **grant** the primitive role of **Owner** to a generic "@gmail.com" account, though, you'll need to **use the web console**. `gcloud` will error out if you try to grant it a permission above Editor.

You can use the following command to **grant a user the primitive role of Editor** to your existing project:

```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT] --member user:[EMAIL] --role roles/editor
```

If you succeeded here, try **accessing the web interface** and exploring from there.

This is the **highest level you can assign using the gcloud tool**.
